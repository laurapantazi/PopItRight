# .gitignore file for Unity 3D projects
# The idea is to ignore everything except the Assets and ProjectSettings directory
# and any files and directories that have been auto-generated in any way or
# manually added to the project's filesystem outside the Assets and ProjectSettings
# directory. Make sure you check the relevant requirements of the current Unity
# version regularly.
# Autogenerated directories (add as needed).
